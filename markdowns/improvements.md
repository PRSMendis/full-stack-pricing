## Improvements

- Good to enforce Conventional Commits.
- Should get rid of unnecessary boiler plate e.g. posts in schema (done)
- SearchArray needs to be updated such that each filter pipes into each other, e.g. you can filter by Brand, then Category e.t.c.
- End to end typesafety is great, but the typing could be better
- The whole project is currently in a state lacking finesse, I was focused on trying to reach the mvp, and then clean up the code - but that's generally how I operate
- There is a bunch of boilerplate that is probably unnecessary that came from the create-t3-app step that I used to initialise the repository; for production this would need to be cleaned up.
